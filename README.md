## Swinburne University of Technology - Technology Inquiry Project (COS60010)
- **Team**: Team 4
- **Team Representative**: <a href="https://dinuka.live">Dinuka Navaratna</a> (104205090@student.swin.edu.au)
- **Project Brief**: Objective of this project was to build a prototype application for an university to hire casual/seasonal staff members by advertising the modules (job vacancies), and by letting potential applicants to submit their interest by applying. And the permanent staff would be able to go through all the applications and decide on who to hire.
- **Future Improvements**: At the moment though the permanent staff can see the applications, they cannot shortlist or reject applications. Also, the profile picture update functionality hasn't been implemented. Meanwhile, currently, the resume upload functionality saves all the files in the backend server, instead in a storage location such as S3. Frontend notifications (alerts/ errors) haven't been parsed properly according to the backend responses. For the immidiate next steps, these functionalities can be implemented.
